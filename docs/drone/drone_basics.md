# Introduction to Drone Systems

This tutorial page gives you a brief overview of a drone system and the physical and software components that make up a drone system 

[TOC]

### What is a UAV or a Drone

A drone or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is an unmanned "robotic" vehicle that can be remotely or autonomously controlled.

Drones are used for many consumer, industrial, government and military applications (opens new window). These include (non exhaustively): aerial photography/video, carrying cargo, racing, search and surveying etc.

> Different types of drones exist for use in air, ground, sea, and underwater. These are (more formally) referred to as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV), Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USV), Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV).

The "brain" of the drone is called an *autopilot*. It consists of flight stack software running on vehicle controller ("flight controller") hardware.

A *multi-rotor* is a specific type of UAV which uses two of more lift-generating rotors to fly. One of the most common will be the Quadrotor which has 4 motors in an 'X' pattern. These UAVs provide much simpler flight control than other types of aerial vehicle. This tutorial focuses on the flight of a simple quadrotor, but Starling can be used to operate many different types of robot.

> From this point on in this tutorial, 'drone' or 'UAV' will refer to a multi-rotor UAV unless otherwise stated.
